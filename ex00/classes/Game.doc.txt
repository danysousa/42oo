Ship[] currentPlayerShips()
=======
The Game class represents the internal state of a game. A Game
has the following concepts:
* players: they are the owners of ships and can battle against
each other. They can be either active or passive, like the
Switzerland player ! :-)
* ships: combat units owned by the players.
* blocks: obstacles on the map that are very hard to get rid of
and can break a ship that collides with them.

A game instance can be constructed like so:
$game = new Game();

Class methods:

static bool exists()
Check if a game in in progress.

static void loadFromFile()
Load a game from its save file.

These are the public instance methods:

bool hasCollision(MapObject $o)
Checks if the MapObject can be placed in the game. Returns true if
it is possible or false if it would create a collision.

void addShip(Ship $ship)
Adds the $ship to the Game.

void addBlock(Block $block)
Adds the $block to the Game.

void addPlayer(Player $player)
Adds the Player to the game.

void start()
Locks the game for registrations and plays the first turn.

void reload()
Deletes the currently saved game.

void playTurn()
Allow the next player to play his turn.

void save()
Saves the game to '../game.txt'.

string toJson()
Returns the ships and blocks as a JSON-able object.

Ship[] playerShips(Player $p)
Returns the ships that belong to a given player.

Ship[] currentPlayerShips()
Returns the ships that belong to the player that is currently playing,
based on the session.
