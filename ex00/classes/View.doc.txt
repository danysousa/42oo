The View class is a simplified templating engine that uses PHP as
the templating language.

An instance can be constructed like so:
$viewEngine = new View($root);

where `$root` is the root directory for templates.

Instance methods:

string render($template, array $params = array());
Computes the output of the template and returns it as a string. Here,
`$template` is of the form `path/to/file` without the '.php' at the end.
