The CollisionMatrix class helps check if there are any collisions
between MapObjects in the game world.

An instance can be constructed like this:

$numRows = 100;
$numCols = 150;
$matrix = new CollisionMatrix($numRows, $numCols);

The CollisionMatrix class provides the following methods:

void addObject(MapObject $o);
Adds a MapObject to the matrix.

bool collision(MapObject $o);
Checks if the addition of the MapObject $o would create a collision on the
matrix, depending on the objects that have previously been added with
`addObject(MapObject $o)`.
